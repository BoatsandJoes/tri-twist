brain chains:
knocking a single piece over onto a colored floor (easiest, maybe too easy?)
towers (2 high or 3 high; can do more with a trench)  
double dominoes (multiple towers)
sandwich
Zangimove

visual effect for a certain trick, on the piece itself so you can see

swapping piece order with hard drop should maybe give points (brain chain)
