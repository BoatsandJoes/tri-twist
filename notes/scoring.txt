emergent chain mechanics:  
use to fake extend the active chain timer
towers (3 high is totally reasonable)  
double dominoes (really difficult with 4 colors, ok with 3)

Probably too easy for a good player to topple single pieces onto a chain as a brain chain; keep an eye on it during playtesting, think of possible solutions ahead of time (maybe can no longer brain chain after getting at least one active chain?)

swapping piece order with hard drop should maybe give points
knocking a piece into a match is worth points  
Tony hawk combo display  
4 match should be bigger than 2 2 matches, but idk exactly how much it should scale up. Depends on chain length distribution  
Tucking into the middle of a chain is already implicitly worth more (longer chain and tuck bonus, especially if chain length is capped), so maybe it doesn't need to award points, but maybe it should
multiple chain clears at the same time could be worth some points, as long as 2 chains aren't too good
dominoes and towers active chains could be worth extra points, but implicitly they already give you an opportunity for more since they give you extra active chain time
Rolling at all could award nominal points.  
	Same for toppling a piece  
Non-active chains could award points and then allow extensions (basically only a 2 chain has meaning), but they are difficult to plan (might be coolâ€¦ but in practice it's hard to not cover the second one up in a narrow grid, test in a wide grid)  
All Clear is easy and shouldn't award points  
Could have a TGM/TAP grading system, tied to score or require to fill up a score counter in a short time to advance, or you have to hit score extensions to get the highest grade (but missing them you don't lose) 

Fast chain when you get within a more strict timer, until you miss one and the rest of the links are now active chain
Active chain looser timer that's worth fewer points
Fast chain pieces don't count toward the maximum number of active chain pieces, which is idk, some number
Galaxy chain is any piece that has come to rest and then you topple it onto a match: implicitly it is a fast chain, definitely explicitly recognized but idk if it should give more points (it already implicitly is a long fast chain that gives you thinking time to extend it)
