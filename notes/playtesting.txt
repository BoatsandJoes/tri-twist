Beth
	plays a lot of tetris and never realized that you can drop more pieces while a piece is falling (fixed by hard drop)  
	if the next piece can't continue a chain, she just does nothing and waits to start a new chain (instead of throwing it to the side to try to continue this chain)
	she thought balancing was a little weird, but was interested in the toppling ("oh, that's unexpected")
	she thinks pieces should be able to stand up against the wall or another piece given that it can stand in the middle of nothing with no support (corroborated by Crimefighter)
	she's doing mostly 2 chains which is part of why she doesn't get too high up (an active chain would naturally raise the stack when you throw junk pieces to the side)    
	she turned arr from 0.05 up to 0.1 instead of down  
	1 frame gravity was too fast   

Beth 2:
	didn't see move limit and was surprised when the game ended
	gravitated towards take your time, would never have played go go go if I didn't ask her to, probably
	liked simulchaineous
	immediately noticed new bar in gogogo
	moved piece 1 to the left and immediately placed without looking; thought the yellow would go on the right but it actually went on the left
	in dig deep didn't realize that you want to clear out all rows above the bottom, thought the goal was to get an all clear in the lowest amount of moves or time
		nice thing about this would be that it wouldn't matter if you're slow, you could still make it in time (and get fewer points or whatever)
		bad thing is the game has to advance towards an end state somehow: there is no reason to not stay at the top making 3 chains for 1000 moves and 7 hours
	likes the bar
	didn't know the triathalon order
	never did a brain chain
	sequential chain has no bar and maybe that's a little weird
	doesn't balance pieces ever, doesn't intuit that it's possible
	extends chains in dig as much as possible even though it's counterproductive to digging
	would probably say that it's easier than Catherine
	sometimes, move rotates, so it's a little weird to say "no, THIS is rotate"
	never looks at previews
	after getting to the bottom in dig, Beth just stops like "I did it yay"
	thinks of google drive logo with these colors (maybe I should replace blue with a very blue purple
	kind of abandons chains as they get big (3+) instead of pushing them to the limit.
	I don't think I've ever seen her start a new chain but then go back to an old chain: once a new one starts, this is the new thing
	only didn't dig to the bottom successfully maybe once
	didn't think anything at all of hitting the chain cap
	likes dig mode

jackie
	high pitched whine
	ui is on top of board a little (still applies to pause menu)
	didn't know about rotate or twist, obviously
	jackie never spins ever (want to see if they will start using it independently) (I've decided to remove it)
they don't use the outermost 2 cells on either side
They don't like to place too many setup pieces before starting to match
their playstyle is to place pieces with many faces exposed and then take matches when they become available
need visual for chain timer
not doing brain chains
thinks it's odd that chains don't share a timer (may be able to make a visual cue that makes that clear, along with the timer)
no hat tricks although they did do some neat balancing
faster gravity would be good even in brain mode (down to 0.1 from 0.2 now), hard drop

andrew multiplayer
	weird that pieces can come in the middle of a chain
	hard to know how much damage will be negated by the chain that is being built currently
	hard to compare chain timer to garbage timer
	if both people always get to the bottom at the same time, neither will ever die
	maybe when an attack timer finshes, any chains that are active at that time need to finish before the attack connects
		the chains and garbage should have an effect to indicate this. New chains and garbage work as normal. Marked garbage is cancelled first
