	plays a lot of tetris and never realized that you can drop more pieces while a piece is falling  
	if the next piece can't continue a chain, she just does nothing and waits to start a new chain (instead of throwing it to the side to try to continue this chain)  
	she thought balancing was a little weird, but was interested in the toppling (unexpected)  
	she thinks pieces should be able to stand up against the wall or another piece given that it can stand in the middle of nothing with no support (corroborated by Crimefighter)  
	she's doing mostly 2 chains which is part of why she doesn't get too high up (an active chain would naturally raise the stack when you throw junk pieces to the side)    
	she turned arr from 0.05 up to 0.1 instead of down  
	1 frame gravity was too fast

	high pitched whine
	ui is on top of board a little (still applies to pause menu)
	didn't know about rotate or twist, obviously
	jackie never spins ever (want to see if they will start using it independently) (I've decided to remove it)
they don't use the outermost 2 cells on either side
They don't like to place too many setup pieces before starting to match
their playstyle is to place pieces with many faces exposed and then take matches when they become available
need visual for chain timer
not doing brain chains
thinks it's odd that chains dont share a timer (may be able to make a visual cue that makes that clear, along with the timer)
no hat tricks although they did do some neat balancing
faster gravity would be good even in brain mode (down to 0.1 from 0.2 now), hard drop
