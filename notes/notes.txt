# tri-twist
todo:
	cooldown on drop to prevent double tap (probably want this to be configurable, since it could eat your input. even if on, it should release if you push left or right or rotate, I guess)
	undo in brain mode
	hook up sound events
	weaken mashing
		move limit
		fewer points for random topple clears
			only award brain chain for pieces that you push over directly
			make zangimove more specific (don't award for getting under random tumbling pieces)
			straight up detect random topple clears and award a low number of points
			don't remove active status by bumping into other falling pieces
		less vertical space
		kill them if they stack too high
		drop cooldown
		cannot drop while any (inactive?) piece is toppling (maybe remove hard drop)
	visuals:  
		fix ghost line visibility (maybe 2nd ghost piece)
		light up ghost piece if it will match?  
		show if ghost will disturb other pieces?
		solid colors should no longer be contiguous, because it looks like they belong together, but they don't
		chain group effect
		spruce up chain timer effect
		Hard drop effect on ghost line
		Hard drop effect on stack surface
		trick effect
		backgrounds
		ui panels
	controller support
	mouse support
	credits/license
	how to play screens
		core mechanics
			controls (left, right, rotate, soft drop, hard drop)
			triangles tumble and balance
			when they settle, they match same color edges
			after that, they knock balancing pieces over
		take your time
			chains stay forever and pop when a piece settles and doesn't match, or at the cap (currently 10)
			move limit
		go go go
			chains pop after a certain amount of time, or at the cap (currently 4). Crucially, you can drop other pieces in between.

on store page, advertise millions of polygons (my idea)

Scope Creep:  
	Character who instead of 4 says 3
		how unthreetunate three you
	Juice in gameplay and menus and characters:  
		Art  
		animations  
		VFX  
		Music  
		SFX  
		color choices (in menu or per character or both)  
	mode ideas:
		Purify/dig race/Dr mario, just focus on downstacking  
			maybe have some incentive to make small chains, idk what  
			could fill board with unmatched pieces and mark some as "clear these" so you have to dig to them (like purify), and big chain marks more as "clear these". Something like that  
			could fill board with garbage instead of normal pieces. Idk if this would be fun so it's worth testing, especially since garbage might make a good versus mode some day.  
		Shared board local coop seems pretty easy to implement compared to all other forms of multiplayer.
	button configuration  
	controller support  
	mobile port  
	Tutorials  

Things that I want but will have to cut:  
	steam leaderboards  
	steam achievements  
	Daily challenge  
	save/share rulesets  
	Chainsim  
	replays  
		watch leaderboard replays  
		export clip/video  
	Mystery/Item mode (see item attacks/buffs in multiplayer)  
	Story mode:  
		Any other mode or item effect can be a stage  
		Could have some floating cells permanently filled as maps  
		Puzzle mode  
		Each stage tracks completion score/time/moves  
			could have stars/goals that gate progress  
			dev records  
		Would love to have story before and after levels  
	Big ruleset changes:  
		Twist mode (basically just bejeweled):  
			Single piece rotate  
			Tumble fill/direct fill  
			Analysis paralysis is a problem  
			Can have no possible moves although it's rareish; need board shakeup like bejewled  
		Literally just Carcassonne  
	Multiplayer:  
		vs cpu  
		GGPO is a C++ module so I could compile the engine with both modules, or remove FMod, or change to FMod GDNative  
		When searching/connecting it should say "Triangulating an opponent"  
		Could have people play 2 single player games side by side and see who wins, either playing a game to completion and seeing who did better, or going over a certain score differential  
		Could have item attacks/buffs like:  
			match anything and whatever matches, mass replace that color with a random other color (probably making a big clear)  
			explode when matched, either in a line or in an area  
			mess with tuning settings (see tuning)  
			Invisible mode  
			All pieces solid colors  
			Piece pairs (this is horrifying)  
			Ice (pieces slide down w/o tumbling and then slide sideways too)  
			Garbage (see garbage)  
		Garbage:  
			come in like:  
				Petal Crash?  
				Tetris (kind of like changing grid size but you can dig out in chunks) (I think I like this one. Only thing I don't like about it is you have to send a FULL line every time. Would need to make the grid big so one line is nbd)  
					another thing: does it do a full diagonal line, putting it lots of extra useless pieces, or mirror stack height but that means you get more if you're doing worse?
						if grid is flat, you just get two lines of garbage, easy
			cleared like:  
				puyo (I think I like this one, because it changes the way you play to shorter chains if you want to dig through multiple lines)  
				Petal Crash garbage attack  
				puzzle fighter (normal piece but unclearable for some moves/time, they're still really not that different from ordinary pieces so idk)  
				tofu (gives opponent points when cleared)  
			Counter like:  
				T99 with garbage limit/delay, better for new players but too easy to defend against when you're good  
				Puyo/guideline  
			Damage formula:  
				same as guideline tetris; include petal crash tug of war for new players since they can't do chains to do damage  
		Each player could do different kinds of attacks, potentially tied to a character (do you pick your attack, or your opponent's attack?)  
		Coop:  
			shared board coop  
			shared score/ramp separate board coop  
			Could send each other helpful items  
			Twist + drop coop
