# tri-twist
	loading screen
	make all later garbage patterns identical between both players in versus (except for top edge, which can change if needed)
	some way to break multiplayer stalemates
	clean up multiplayer double pause menu
	reset settings on this tab to defaults button
	saving scores + displaying best scores
	"are you sure?" on quit, restart, back to menu
	try to adjust dig deep to be good for new players and then make it the main mode (current problem is if you can't make it to the bottom in 2 minutes then that kind of sucks)
	allow selection of "Keyboard&Mouse" device
	menu selection follows mouse on button hover
	menu selection is retained when drilling down and coming back
	add p2 das and p2 arr
	keyboard/controller input on button config menu
	actual button config
	improved ai
	store cpu difficulty in config object
	device selection should be wiped always except when restarting a game or exiting to a place beyond device select
		rethink settings menu button config idk, maybe it's fine as is
	online play
		our board is unaffected and never has to be saved or changed in any way except for garbage prediction, particularly on time up
		selecting piece colors and garbage colors before they're shown to the player will help the visuals (color selection may have to be rewound and redone if our opponent actually spawned a bunch of garbage)
	visuals:
		grid background
		particles
		make score - display not shunt the number to the side
		fix ghost line visibility (maybe 2nd ghost piece)
		light up ghost piece if it will match?  
		show if ghost will disturb other pieces?
		fix corners of chain group effect
		Hard drop effect on ghost line
		Hard drop effect on stack surface
		trick effect
		topple effect
		animation when sending an attack, including when reaching the bottom of the grid
		some kind of effect on reaching the bottom of the grid in dig mode
		backgrounds
	Versus menu item
		settings -> controls side select (implicit vs cpu) and button config
			mode popup with buttons "start" and "back" along with these items (both players have cursors):
				tutorial text and pictures
					chains and clearing above the line sends/defends garbage; top out = lose
				CPU wait time (if vs cpu)
				CPU intelligence (if vs cpu)
				may have these settings idk
					clear timer setting
					garbage timer setting
					last defense on/off
					chain cap setting
					score values setting (separate menu)
					time limit (higher score wins)

Scope Creep:  
	Character who instead of 4 says 3
		how unthreetunate three you
	mobile port
	steam leaderboards  
	steam achievements  
	Daily challenge  
	save/share rulesets  
	Chainsim  
	replays  
		watch leaderboard replays  
		export clip/video  
	Mystery/Item mode (see item attacks/buffs in multiplayer)  
	Story mode:  
		Any other mode or item effect can be a stage  
		Could have some floating cells permanently filled as maps  
		Puzzle mode  
		Each stage tracks completion score/time/moves  
			could have stars/goals that gate progress  
			dev records  
		Would love to have story before and after levels  
	Big ruleset changes:  
		Twist mode (basically just bejeweled):  
			Single piece rotate  
			Tumble fill/direct fill  
			Analysis paralysis is a problem  
			Can have no possible moves although it's rareish; need board shakeup like bejewled  
		Literally just Carcassonne  
	Multiplayer:
		GGPO is a C++ module so I could compile the engine with both modules, or remove FMod, or change to FMod GDNative  
		When searching/connecting it should say "Triangulating an opponent"
		Could have people play 2 single player games side by side and see who wins, either playing a game to completion and seeing who did better, or going over a certain score differential
		Could have item attacks/buffs like:  
			match anything and whatever matches, mass replace that color with a random other color (probably making a big clear)  
			explode when matched, either in a line or in an area  
			mess with tuning settings (see tuning)  
			Invisible mode  
			All pieces solid colors  
			Piece pairs (this is horrifying)  
			Ice (pieces slide down w/o tumbling and then slide sideways too)  
			Garbage (see garbage)  
		Garbage:
			cleared like:  
				puyo (I think I like this one, because it changes the way you play to shorter chains if you want to dig through multiple lines)  
				Petal Crash garbage attack  
				puzzle fighter (normal piece but unclearable for some moves/time, they're still really not that different from ordinary pieces so idk)  
				tofu (gives opponent points when cleared)
		Each player could do different kinds of attacks, potentially tied to a character (do you pick your attack, or your opponent's attack?)  
		Coop:  
			shared board coop  
			shared score/ramp separate board coop  
			Could send each other helpful items
