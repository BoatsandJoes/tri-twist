# tri-twist
	design all menus
	garbage preview:
		when attack bar is active, show inverted triangle preview (cell is responsible for drawing it)
			goes in empty cells or active chains
			if active chains will cancel garbage, turn the preview garbage at the end ghostly
		during last defense, same thing, but the preview garbage turns orange and only goes in active chains that are part of THAT defense.
			keep a record of all cells that are part of the defense, not just the one showing the timer
				add to record when a piece is added to a chain. store it next to score info
			if last defense chains for this defense will cancel garbage, turn the preview garbage ghostly and move it to the end of the garbage queue (order is solid orange, solid white, ghost white, ghost orange)
				if any is left over, apply to offet attack that has not landed
	attack preview:
		after offset previews are applied, show remaining attack preview above and to the left for ongoing chains
		different iconography for 1, 10. bottom row is 1-9, then 10s appear on 2nd+ rows
	title
	button config
	clean up multiplayer double pause menu
	controller device select
	color selection
	reset settings on this tab to defaults button
	saving scores + displaying best scores
	rework all menus, particularly mode select to clearly group how to play and show scores and maybe allow some settings changes, like button config/device select
	"are you sure?" on quit
	how to play pictures
	how to play scoring
	how to play multiplayer + advanced how to play multiplayer
	undo in brain mode
	mouse only mode (may be handled by button config)
	try to adjust dig deep to be good for new players and then make it the main mode (current problem is if you can't make it to the bottom in 2 minutes then that kind of sucks)
	save/resume brain mode
		replays?
	multiplayer
		shared board local coop
			ghost piece different color, active/ghost piece that color outline and also p2's active is upside-down
		single player score competition (two boards can move ui to above grid and remove non-essential elements to make room)
	online play
		piece sequence generated ahead of time and shared (1000 pieces then loops)
		incoming garbage delayed by at least a few frames on time out to account for latency (maybe the attacker extended at the last moment) (attack can no longer be extended, but can still be offset)
		make game 100% deterministic
		serialize opponent game state every frame
		use prediction to guess what opponent is doing now based on what they were doing a second ago
		if their real inputs differ, roll back their board
		our board is unaffected and never has to be saved or changed in any way except for garbage prediction, particularly on time up
		selecting piece colors and garbage colors before they're shown to the player will help the visuals (color selection may have to be rewound and redone if our opponent actually spawned a bunch of garbage)
	ais (can vary thinking/pause time)
		random drop
		1 deep match search
		1 deep match search with board evaluation (can limit branches to check)
		2 deep match search
	visuals:
		grid background
		show incoming garbage on top of ghost piece
		particles
		persist matched area and then apply some effect to it (even though actual pieces have cleared)
		make score - display not shunt the number to the side
		fix ghost line visibility (maybe 2nd ghost piece)
		light up ghost piece if it will match?  
		show if ghost will disturb other pieces?
		fix corners of chain group effect
		Hard drop effect on ghost line
		Hard drop effect on stack surface
		trick effect
		topple effect
		backgrounds
		buttons + arrow

on store page, advertise millions of polygons (my idea)

Scope Creep:  
	Character who instead of 4 says 3
		how unthreetunate three you
	Juice in gameplay and menus and characters:  
		Art  
		animations  
		VFX  
		Music  
		SFX  
		color choices (in menu or per character or both)
	mobile port

Things that I want but will have to cut:  
	steam leaderboards  
	steam achievements  
	Daily challenge  
	save/share rulesets  
	Chainsim  
	replays  
		watch leaderboard replays  
		export clip/video  
	Mystery/Item mode (see item attacks/buffs in multiplayer)  
	Story mode:  
		Any other mode or item effect can be a stage  
		Could have some floating cells permanently filled as maps  
		Puzzle mode  
		Each stage tracks completion score/time/moves  
			could have stars/goals that gate progress  
			dev records  
		Would love to have story before and after levels  
	Big ruleset changes:  
		Twist mode (basically just bejeweled):  
			Single piece rotate  
			Tumble fill/direct fill  
			Analysis paralysis is a problem  
			Can have no possible moves although it's rareish; need board shakeup like bejewled  
		Literally just Carcassonne  
	Multiplayer:
		GGPO is a C++ module so I could compile the engine with both modules, or remove FMod, or change to FMod GDNative  
		When searching/connecting it should say "Triangulating an opponent"
		Could have people play 2 single player games side by side and see who wins, either playing a game to completion and seeing who did better, or going over a certain score differential
		Could have item attacks/buffs like:  
			match anything and whatever matches, mass replace that color with a random other color (probably making a big clear)  
			explode when matched, either in a line or in an area  
			mess with tuning settings (see tuning)  
			Invisible mode  
			All pieces solid colors  
			Piece pairs (this is horrifying)  
			Ice (pieces slide down w/o tumbling and then slide sideways too)  
			Garbage (see garbage)  
		Garbage:
			cleared like:  
				puyo (I think I like this one, because it changes the way you play to shorter chains if you want to dig through multiple lines)  
				Petal Crash garbage attack  
				puzzle fighter (normal piece but unclearable for some moves/time, they're still really not that different from ordinary pieces so idk)  
				tofu (gives opponent points when cleared)
		Each player could do different kinds of attacks, potentially tied to a character (do you pick your attack, or your opponent's attack?)  
		Coop:  
			shared board coop  
			shared score/ramp separate board coop  
			Could send each other helpful items  
			Twist + drop coop
