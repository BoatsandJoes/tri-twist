		garbage gogogo/dig deep vs mode
			piece sequence generated ahead of time and shared (1000 pieces then loops)
			you don't lose points for making a move in either mode
			fill up opponent's board to win
			1000 points = 1 sent garbage (including dig deep bonus, which will cause you to instantly win if not offset.)
			incoming garbage delayed by at least a few frames, mostly to account for latency, but should help the defender a tiny bit
			offset allowed
			garbage comes in after an active-dropped piece lands and does not clear anything
				consider a player who deliberately builds up high (or is sent garbage) and then they have a lot they can dig through without being sent garbage: this is okay because if you mess up you die
			if you cannot accept all garbage, you lose
			garbage spawns bottom to top left to right in the first available spaces
			Go Go Go needs margin time
	online play
		GGPO approach
			make game 100% deterministic
			serialize opponent game state every frame
			use prediction to guess what opponent is doing now based on what they were doing a second ago
			if their real inputs differ, roll back their board
			our board is unaffected and never has to be saved or changed in any way
			sent garbage is on a delay to help with latency (making our board unaffected)
			selecting piece colors and garbage colors before they're shown to the player will help the visuals (color selection may have to be rewound and redone if our opponent actually spawned a bunch of garbage)

Scope Creep:  
	Character who instead of 4 says 3
		how unthreetunate three you
	Juice in gameplay and menus and characters:  
		Art  
		animations  
		VFX  
		Music  
		SFX  
		color choices (in menu or per character or both)  
	mode ideas:
		Purify/dig race/Dr mario, just focus on downstacking  
			maybe have some incentive to make small chains, idk what  
			could fill board with unmatched pieces and mark some as "clear these" so you have to dig to them (like purify), and big chain marks more as "clear these". Something like that  
			could fill board with garbage instead of normal pieces. Idk if this would be fun so it's worth testing, especially since garbage might make a good versus mode some day.  
		Shared board local coop seems pretty easy to implement compared to all other forms of multiplayer.

Things that I want but will have to cut:  
	steam leaderboards  
	steam achievements  
	Daily challenge  
	save/share rulesets  
	Chainsim  
	replays  
		watch leaderboard replays  
		export clip/video  
	Mystery/Item mode (see item attacks/buffs in multiplayer)  
	Story mode:  
		Any other mode or item effect can be a stage  
		Could have some floating cells permanently filled as maps  
		Puzzle mode  
		Each stage tracks completion score/time/moves  
			could have stars/goals that gate progress  
			dev records  
		Would love to have story before and after levels  
	Big ruleset changes:  
		Twist mode (basically just bejeweled):  
			Single piece rotate  
			Tumble fill/direct fill  
			Analysis paralysis is a problem  
			Can have no possible moves although it's rareish; need board shakeup like bejewled  
		Literally just Carcassonne  
	Multiplayer:  
		vs cpu  
		GGPO is a C++ module so I could compile the engine with both modules, or remove FMod, or change to FMod GDNative  
		When searching/connecting it should say "Triangulating an opponent"  
		Could have people play 2 single player games side by side and see who wins, either playing a game to completion and seeing who did better, or going over a certain score differential  
		Could have item attacks/buffs like:  
			match anything and whatever matches, mass replace that color with a random other color (probably making a big clear)  
			explode when matched, either in a line or in an area  
			mess with tuning settings (see tuning)  
			Invisible mode  
			All pieces solid colors  
			Piece pairs (this is horrifying)  
			Ice (pieces slide down w/o tumbling and then slide sideways too)  
			Garbage (see garbage)  
		Garbage:  
			come in like:  
				Petal Crash?  
				Tetris (kind of like changing grid size but you can dig out in chunks) (I think I like this one. Only thing I don't like about it is you have to send a FULL line every time. Would need to make the grid big so one line is nbd)  
					another thing: does it do a full diagonal line, putting it lots of extra useless pieces, or mirror stack height but that means you get more if you're doing worse?
						if grid is flat, you just get two lines of garbage, easy
			cleared like:  
				puyo (I think I like this one, because it changes the way you play to shorter chains if you want to dig through multiple lines)  
				Petal Crash garbage attack  
				puzzle fighter (normal piece but unclearable for some moves/time, they're still really not that different from ordinary pieces so idk)  
				tofu (gives opponent points when cleared)  
			Counter like:  
				T99 with garbage limit/delay, better for new players but too easy to defend against when you're good  
				Puyo/guideline  
			Damage formula:  
				same as guideline tetris; include petal crash tug of war for new players since they can't do chains to do damage  
		Each player could do different kinds of attacks, potentially tied to a character (do you pick your attack, or your opponent's attack?)  
		Coop:  
			shared board coop  
			shared score/ramp separate board coop  
			Could send each other helpful items  
			Twist + drop coop
