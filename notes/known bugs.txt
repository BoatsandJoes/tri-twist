sometimes scorecard is not clearing one combo in sequential mode
floating pieces
pieces clearing pushes pieces in non-deterministic directions depending on clear order (can fix this by having clearing piece ask neighbor to check what they should do instead of telling them)
ghost piece doesn't tumble off cliffs, instead dropping straight down
sometimes cells out of the first row cannot be focused
dropping a balancing piece next to a falling piece predicts a push when no push will occur
