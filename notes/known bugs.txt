* pieces clearing pushes pieces in non-deterministic directions depending on clear order (move clear vertical_point into new method that clears the chain without pushing, and then write a second method that checks the whole grid for pieces that should fall and how, which will be called in a pair with clear())
* got a gravity bug on video
* game end has odd behavior (doesn't clear lucky chains), seems to clear too many things in go go go (on video), ended game too early in go go go one time (on video)
* saw a triangle clear with point facing up, balancing triangle above tumbled to the right
* dig mode transition in triathalon unconditionally overwrites rows instead of conditionally moving them up
* in triathalon dig, there was a piece that cleared individually somehow
* multiplayer settings crash
* active piece starting position does not go to mouse even if device is mouse
* p2 versus grid drifts left (relative to p1 board) as horizontal resolution shrinks
* single piece stays highlighted after board moves up? (check video)
* mouse controls in multiplayer use unscaled board positions for mouse pointer
* if one player readies and then the other player opens button config, the player is unreadied for some reason
* restart broken in every mode except dig and versus

might be fixed
* saw a case where it looked like two chains didn't combine properly in active chain mode (only one chain actually active, it got stuck in "other chains" while the displayed chain "simulchaineous" kept counting up)
* If a chain clears via cap and the scorecard is still showing and then you put another chain in a place that includes the old root, the new chain immediately clears. At least, I thought that's what was causing it?
* take your time mode scorecard, when a sequential chain caps, changes over to the other chain without properly updating "other chains" (should be 0, is instead a big number). When a chain combines and caps at the same time, scorecard remains white and keeps other chains + total even though it should turn blue and then vanish.
* game crash on return to mode select
