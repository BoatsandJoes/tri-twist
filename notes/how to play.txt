core mechanics
	when triangles settle, they match same color edges
	triangles tumble and balance, too!

modes
	take your time
		chains stay forever and pop when a piece settles and doesn't match
		move limit
	go go go
		chains pop after a certain amount of time. Crucially, you can drop other pieces in between.
		time limit
	dig deep
		same as go go go but you start with three rows of garbage. Dig 2 out to get points!
		time limit
	triathalon
		Take your time, go go go, and dig deep back to back: get the best score you can!

scoring
	active/sequential chain
	chain length
		cap exists
		Can circumvent cap with double trouble, hat trick, brain chain
	lucky chain
		worth only 1 point, counts toward cap
	double trouble
	hat trick
	simulchaineous
		just for fun because I like the name, worth only 1 point
	brain chain
		push
		tower
		double dominoes
		Zangimove
	deduct nominal points for matching
