modes + references:
menu, take your time mode ( https://tetr.io menu, bejeweled zen mode)
go go go mode (current time limit is 2 minutes, this might change. Could reference TGM 1/2/3 normal mode/master mode but I don't neccesarily want songs in that style, it's just a pace thing)

modes that may get cut:
boss mode/hard difficulty mode (reference TGM 2 The Absolute Death+, Death mode and TGM3 Shirase mode)

core sfx:
piece settling into place without matching (I think of a click)
piece matching
ascending pitch sfx for connected matches of ascending quantity, capping at around 6-10 (reference Petal Crash)
"match that is worth extra points" sfx (fast chain, one piece matching multiple other pieces at once, tumbling a piece into a match, hitting chain cap)
piece actually clearing (could cascade, may also cascade visually, idk yet)
You're close to the time/move limit (one sfx for 10 away, and another repeated for 5 4 3 2 1)
game end (I think of an annoying whistle? It doesn't need to be an annoying whistle)

extra sfx:
piece knocking another piece over
pause
menu button click (could reuse piece settling sounds)
game is about to start jingle
countdown/start
"can't drop there"

potentially annoying sounds but maybe they'd be neat:
moving piece edge contacting another piece edge (maybe only if one is stationary, or quiet them down if many are tumbling at once?)
active piece shift/rotate (some versions of Tetris have this, notably Tetris Effect)
piece release (seems redundant)

sfx tied to modes or mechanics that may be cut:
piece settling into place from instant gravity/hard drop (a woosh and thump)
Goal completed
