modes + references:
menu, take your time mode ( https://tetr.io menu, bejeweled zen mode)
go go go mode, dig deep mode (current time limit is 2 minutes, this might change. Could reference TGM 1/2/3 normal mode/master mode but I don't necessarily want songs in that style, it's just a pace thing)

core sfx:
piece matching
ascending pitch sfx for connected matches of ascending quantity, capping at some number (currently 5) (reference Petal Crash)
"match that is worth extra points" sfx (tumbling a piece into a match)
piece actually clearing (could cascade, may also cascade visually, idk yet)
You're close to the time/move limit (one sfx for 10 away, and repeated for 5 4 3 2 1)
game end (I think of an annoying whistle? It doesn't need to be an annoying whistle)

extra sfx:
piece settling into place without matching (I think of a click)
special piece settling from hard drop (I think whoosh and thump)
piece knocking another piece over
pause
menu button click (could reuse piece settling sounds)
game is about to start jingle
countdown/start
"can't drop there"
incoming garbage (can reuse "lots of points piece match" sound effect since it grants 50000 points)

potentially annoying sounds but maybe they'd be neat:
moving piece edge contacting another piece edge (maybe only if one is stationary, or quiet them down if many are tumbling at once?)
active piece shift/rotate (some versions of Tetris have this, notably Tetris Effect)
piece release (seems redundant)
