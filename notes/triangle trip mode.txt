Story select between active and passive chain modes
Each story has some # of levels and then a boss at the end
levels have a list of goals and you need about 75% of all available goals completed to unlock the next level
you can end a level at any time to move to the next one, or when you hit the limit the run ends and you can retry the level to pick up other goals or move on to an earlier/later level or quit to menu
boss gives you one goal at a time (fixed list or random?) and you have to complete it in a limit, if you miss then you get hit, if you get hit 3 times you lose. If you either survive to the end or hit the boss enough times, then you beat the boss (what if there is one goal that they just get hit every time? That sucks)
have way to erase progress without erasing records (and allow to restore unlocked stuff, it's just for speedrunning)
if you beat both bosses, unlock a final level/boss of some kind
true final boss if you do fulfill certain stat conditions? Game should at least recognize it in some way, I think. careful of save scumming.

# two tricks
# hat tricks
# simulchainenous
make a chain that completely encircles a certain block with point face down (and connects in a cycle)
make a clear on top of a certain cell (can further restrict the clear to a hat trick, for example)
make this many moves/matches (they're basically the same)
tumble through these points (could be fun on ice, or as a slalom in sequential chain mode)

goal restrictions list
sequential mode only: chain with only twists
sequential mode only: chain with no twists
only brain chains count

level restrictions list
# previews
no rotate
# twists
can drop pieces in but only score by twisting (fallen matched pieces either behave normally and give no points, or vanish w/o matching, or can't make a move that would match)
more colors
oops! all berries
lower chain timer
lower chain cap (even 0, brain chains only, extendable by brain/quick chains)
smaller grid
slidey pieces
piece pairs

pressure list:
move limit
time limit
rising/falling garbage
drop timer

Sequential (timer off by default but option to turn it on):
Stage 1:
default colors, gravity
move limit some number (300? 200?)
goals:
chain score 700
total score 7000
do a two trick

Ice Cold Beer

Active:
Stage 1:
default colors, gravity
time limit some number (3 mins? 2 mins?)
goals:
chain score 500
total score 5000
do a two trick

Ice Cold Beer

Ice cold beer stage:
all pieces above row 1 that do not match vanish either immediately or after a short time/# of moves (depending on chain mode)
have to make a match on a certain triangle, when you do, it ends your chain and a more difficult triangle appears
reach all cells in the time limit (move limit? chain limit?) in order to win. maybe don't track score, just time/moves/chains (depending on chain mode).
could have one think ahead level and one go go go level
