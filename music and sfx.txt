modes + mood references:
menu https://tetr.io
zen mode (bejeweled zen mode) (could share music with menu)
some sort of normal difficulty mode (hit certain score thresholds in time to extend the game) (chain timer may get shorter as the game goes on, idk yet) (reference TGM 1, 2, and 3 Master Mode and TGM 2 Normal Mode)
custom settings mode (music select, probably)
game over jingle
you win jingle

modes that may get cut:
hard difficulty mode (reference TGM 2 The Absolute Death+ mode)

sfx:
piece settling into place against a stationary piece or the wall, without matching (I think of a click)
piece settling into place against a stationary piece or the wall, with matching
ascending pitch sfx for connected matches of ascending quantity, capping at around 8 (cap may be tied to scoring mechanics that aren't decided yet) (reference Petal Crash)
piece actually clearing
piece knocking another piece over
pause
menu button click (could reuse piece settling sounds)
menu option increase/decrease (could just click)
game is about to start jingle
countdown/start
game end (I think of an annoying whistle? It doesn't need to be an annoying whistle)
"can't drop there/can't rotate that way"
You reached the time extension score threshold (reference TGM grade advance, but really I think of a racing game guy going "TIME EXTENDED")
after a combo finishes, the accrued score ticks up into your total score (in zen mode only)

potentially annoying sounds but maybe they'd be neat:
moving piece edge contacting another piece edge (maybe only if one is stationary, or quiet them down if many are tumbling at once?)
active piece shift/rotate (some versions of Tetris have this, notably Tetris Effect)
piece release (seems redundant)

sfx tied to modes or mechanics that may be cut:
You're close to the score/time/move limit (one sfx for 10 away, and another repeated for 5 4 3 2 1)
match satisfying some restriction that gives extra points (like T spins) (currently thinking toppling a piece into a match, matching 2 or 3 sides at once, and puyo puyo-style chains
piece settling into place from instant gravity/hard drop (a woosh and thump)
